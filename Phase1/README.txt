The first phase of our project reads the Reddit data in JSON format that has been collected, cleaned, and merged from various sources. The mapper part of the first phase creates a line of "author" and "subreddit" for any comment found in the data. The reducer part of Phase1 then appends all the subreddits in a list for each user, which will then be entered into the program for Phase 2.
