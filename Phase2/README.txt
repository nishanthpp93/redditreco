In phase 2, the mapper portion takes individual subreddits and tuples of subreddits that have been commented on and assigns a value of 1 to each. It also check if a user's comment has been deleted so we don't count that in our calculation of subreddit similarity since there is no way to identify the user. The reducer phase then sums up all the values so we have a count of every individual subreddit and  every tuple pair of subreddits that have been commented on by users.
